# Wind Data Analysis Software

## I. Introduction

Windographer software is designed for importing, analyzing and visualizing wind resource data measured by met tower, sodar or lidar.<br/>
This software will be able to quickly import data from a variety of different formats allowing for rapid quality control and statistical analyses, including measure-correlate-predict (MCP), and the functionality to export data to almost any wind flow model that is commonly used within the wind power industry.

<b>Note : </b>
<b>Current Version 1.0.0 consists of 3 major tests </b>

<h2>II. Implementation</h2>

The software was implemented using Tkinter which is a standard Python GUI Library.

<h3><b>Libraries Used:</b></h3>

- numpy==1.19.3
- pandas==1.1.3
- matplotlib==3.3.3
- Pillow==8.2.0
- openpyxl==3.0.7
- scipy==1.5.4

<h2>Features</h2>

- Analyze and manage multiple data by creating workspaces.
- Efficient Processing and Quick Results - Able to import automatically determine the data structure, identifying which columns contain speed, direction, temperature, pressure.
- Run multiple tests parellely and view them simultaneously for comparitive study.
- Scrollable and Interactive Visualization Plots - visualization plots that allows you to zoom in and out, scroll forwards or backwards in time, show or hide data columns, resample and compare side-by-side all with single clicks.
- Crucial tests - Tests based on wind trends and patterns to determine the effectiveness of wind mills.
